Chrome-UA-MOD
=============
An external program with no browser extensions to install, that passes custom user agent strings to Google Chrome, or other Chromium derivatives. This program pulls thousands of known user agent strings from the website http://useragentstring.com/, and categorizes them based on browser types (search bots, game consoles, mobile devices, web browsers, etc). It allows you to view a website in Chromium/Chrome, as though you were using a different type of device entirely. Can be useful for web developers, and also for people looking to bypass server side filters that are based on user agent strings.
